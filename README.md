Developed a dictionary web application employing HTML, PHP, and MySQL. It effectively stores word data and dynamically presents comprehensive details.
# Description
I developed a dictionary web application using HTML, PHP, and MySQL, designed to store and manage a comprehensive collection of words and their meanings. The front-end, built with HTML, features an intuitive user interface for easy word search and display of definitions, synonyms, antonyms, and usage examples. The back-end, powered by PHP, handles user queries, retrieves word data from a MySQL database, and dynamically updates search results in real-time. Additionally, the application allows for word additions, updates, and deletions, making it easily scalable and maintainable. It ensures fast data retrieval and offers a smooth, interactive user experience.
